##  Overview

This project implements a **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** system for **approximate nearest neighbor search** in high-dimensional spaces.

It includes:
- A **sequential CPU version** to validate correctness and benchmark performance.
- A **parallel CUDA version** leveraging GPU acceleration for massive speedups.

>  For detailed technical explanations, please refer to the [Project Report](./project_report.pdf).

##  Motivation

As datasets grow in size and dimensionality, sequential LSH becomes computationally expensive.  
This project explores how **GPU parallelism** (via CUDA) can:
- Greatly **reduce computation time**,  
- Optimize **memory access and data transfer**,  
- Ensure **scalability** for large-scale similarity search problems.

##  Sequential Implementation

- Implements standard LSH algorithm for nearest neighbor search.  
- Uses random hyperplanes to hash points into buckets.  
- Employs C++ STL containers (`std::map`, `std::set`) for efficient storage.  

**Key Concepts:**
- Hash function:  
  \[
  h(x) = \frac{a \cdot x + b}{w}
  \]
- Multi-level hashing for better accuracy (`L1`, `L2` layers).  
- Complexity:  
  - Hash computation: O(d)  
  - Lookup: Sublinear time

##  Parallel CUDA Implementation

###  CUDA Kernels
- **`generateLSHParams`**  
  Initializes random vectors and biases (`a`, `b`) for hash functions in parallel.
- **`computeHashes`**  
  Computes hash values for each data point using thousands of GPU threads.
- **`hashingComputingCUDA`**  
  Performs dot products and hash computation inside each thread for one data point.

###  Memory & Execution
- Custom memory management using raw pointers (`double*`) to GPU memory.  
- Avoids unnecessary data transfers between CPU and GPU.  
- Achieves significant speedups for large datasets.

---

##  Results & Observations

- GPU implementation achieves **massive performance gains** over the sequential version.  
- The final system is both **scalable** and **memory-efficient**.  
- A structured pipeline from data loading → hashing → bucket assignment → retrieval.

>  See *Section 3: Parallel Implementation* in the [Project Report](./project_report.pdf) for in-depth kernel explanations and figures.

##  Future Work

- Parallelize the dot product computation (`hashingComputingCUDA`) using **warp-level reductions**.  
- Integrate **CUDA memory debugging tools** (`cuda-memcheck`).  
- Add adaptive parameter tuning for `w`, `L1`, `L2`.  
- Implement **benchmarking scripts** comparing CPU vs GPU performance.
